Implement user input, corrections, and a simple visual model.

While user input will stay the same, the visual style will have options.

# Visual options
    1 # Bag fills from left to right top to bottom.
    2 # Bag fills from left to right bottom to top.
    3 # Bag fills via a sand simulation.
        # When the bag size is declared an hour glass visual is created.
        # Maybe all of declared sand is stored in the top, or its just a few dummy sands and only the bottom exists.
            # basically do you generate 100% of an hourglass or just 52% (The bottom and a little bit of the funnel)
        # When the user inputs hours, sand falls from the top to the bottom.
