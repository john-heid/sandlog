## Sandlog
- Sandlog is a habit tracking console application with a sand aesthetic.

## Why
- This was inspired by Steam, which tracks the hours of video game time a user has. This metric comes up fairly often in discussions between players, while also providing a sense of satisfaction in skill-based competitive games. Sandlog is an attempt to capture some of that satisfaction for more productive habits. While it is possible to add application to your steam library to have them be tracked automatically, I wanted a more general tracker where I can manually input how much I'd done, and in whatever unit I choose.
